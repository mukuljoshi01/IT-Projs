# IT Projects
** Advanced System Stability and Security**

This project enhances system stability and security by monitoring processes, identifying high-memory usage, and detecting potential threats. Using Python scripts and modules (os, getpass, socket, datetime), it generates detailed reports, improves IT infrastructure  
performance, and ensures robust security protocols against unauthorized access and malware threats.

**Penetration Testing and Network Security: Advanced Exploitation Techniques**

This project focuses on identifying and mitigating network vulnerabilities using advanced exploitation techniques. Tools like netdiscover, hping3, and Nmap were used to uncover weaknesses such as outdated software (Apache, Vim, LibreOffice), lack of hard disk encryption, and insecure bash history. It emphasizes the need for updated software and robust security protocols, providing comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation strategies to enhance system security and resilience against breaches.

**Future of Operating Systems: Addressing Challenges and Innovations**

This project explores current OS challenges in security, memory management, and scalability. It highlights future technologies like enhanced usability, IoT integration, and AI advancements to address these issues. Emphasizing the development of secure, scalable OS with efficient memory management and AI integration, the project overcomes hurdles like high R&D costs and information security. It provides a comprehensive overview of OS advancements and innovation.

**Capstone Project: Virtual Coffee Shop**

An immersive online social platform created by Tech ProJENY, allowing users to interact in a virtual coffee shop. Features include user authentication, virtual tours, and real-time chat at virtual tables. Powered by a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, PHP) and secured with pfSense and SSL certificates. The project includes a VMware virtualized environment, HTML, CSS, JavaScript client-side, and robust SQL server for data handling. Designed for scalability and enhanced usability, offering a versatile social experience without physical presence.
